            <p>Lacrosse has its origins in a tribal game played by all eastern Woodlands Native Americans and by some Plains Indians tribes in what is now the US and Canada. The game has been modernized extensively by European immigrants to create its current form. Modern day lacrosse descends from and resembles games played by various Native American communities. To them, the game resembled a battle, and many tribes called lacrosse a scaled-down version of war. They played with balls and sticks, and often had teams with large numbers of players on the field at once.</p>

            <p>Over time, as more European immigrants came to the Americas, the game became integrated into the new cultures and evolved with the people that were playing it. Today, lacrosse is a largely collegiate and professional sport, and is beocming more popular every year as the interest in it grows. Hopefully, the game will gain as much support as some of the other top sports in the US.</p>
