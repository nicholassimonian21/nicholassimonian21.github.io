  <h2>Three Impactful Things I Learned</h2>
    <div id="impact1">
      I learned a pretty substantive history of the internet. This was impactful because I hadn't thought about each advancement that had been made. Also, this infomration will help me craft my own website in the future.

    <div id="impact2">
      I gained a lot of knowledge about top-level domains. These are the roots that come after a website name: .com, .org, .net, etc. Each root has its own meaning and classifications. Also, roots offer a lot of information about where the website is from and who it is from.

    <div id="impact3">
      GitHub Interest Pages are really exciting to me. CS Topics has already taught me how to build my own website, and that will impact me in this class and beyond.
